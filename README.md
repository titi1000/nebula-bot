# Nebula Bot

Nebula Bot is a useful bot coded in Python. It is functional and already has a lot of features, but is not completely finished... voXrey and I don't have enough time to continue. So we're leaving it open source and on hold for now! This bot uses MySQL and Sqlite3 databases.

## Features
- Logs
- Custom announces
- Custom welcome and leave messages + autorole
- Custom giveaways
- Mods commands

- Commands blacklist

## How to run the bot
1. Add the necessary information to the config.toml file (you will need to create databases)
2. Install all the requirements by running the following command :
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the bot with the following command :
